Real-time obstacle avoidance with deep reinforcement learning * Three-Dimensional Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance for UAV. Letting drones autonomously avoid obstacles is still the focus of research by aviation scholars. Path planning capabilities are essential for autonomous control systems. An autonomous drone must be able to rapidly compute feasible and energy-efﬁcient paths to avoid collisions. From a review of recent studies, we identify key factors that need to be considered in a robust path planner for drones. We also highlight key limitations with existing algorithms and some ofthe work being performed withexisting algorithms. We then use these results to identify factors thatneed to beaddressed in future studies in order to develop a practical path planners for autonomous drones. Back to Mail Online home.

The article has two major contributions: the possibility of using deep reinforcementlearning in UAV obstacle avoidance is verified, and the real-time ability is proved by testing the non-training scenarios in v-rep. The review is of common methods suggested for drones to navigate anenvironment and path generation techniques. It is also an attempt to highlight some of the key limitations of existing algorithms for path planning for drones, as well as some of their key strengths and weaknesses. The study is published in the online edition of the Journal of Robotics and Automation, a peer-reviewed journal published by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) (http://www.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/jomr.2014.1/1/2/2.

In this paper, the modeling and simulation of the common obstacle scenarios of drones are carried out in the v-rep simulation. Several algorithms based on DQN are used to perform visual-based obstacle avoidance experiments. The adaptation and robustness of various algorithms to visual obstacle avoidance is studied. Reinforcement learning can be applied to the autonomous flight of the aircraft. An algorithm, deep Q-network, solved the problem that reinforcement learning used neural network toimate state space andinstability. It can also be used to improve the speed and efficiency of image processing and improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
